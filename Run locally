#Instructions on how to run locally (without sending a job) in Narval folder

#copy your working folder that contains all files needed for the run, e.g. "ncov_test1", into /path/COVID_covarrnet/Nextstrain (where the environment is installed)

#In the Nextstrain folder:

#create virtual environment called nextstrain
module load python
virtualenv --no-download nextstrain
#activate the nextstrain environment
source nextstrain/bin/activate

#load cc modules
module load gcc mafft iq-tree raxml fasttree vcftools scipy-stack
#ensure that everything is in the path
export PATH="/path/Nextstrain:$PATH"

#enter the run's folder to execute the run:
cd ncov_test1
snakemake --profile my_profiles/getting_started/ -p # <- change this
